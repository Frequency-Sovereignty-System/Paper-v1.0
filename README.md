VERSION AUTHORITY

Only the controller of the canonical release repository and listed ENS anchors may publish official versions (v1.1 / v2.0 and beyond).
Forks must not be presented as authoritative versions.

HOW TO VERIFY (ENS → CID)

To verify provenance continuity:
(1) Resolve ENS text records for CID pointers (e.g., pfip:latest_cid, pfip:snapshot).
(2) Retrieve the referenced snapshot via the CID.
(3) Compare the snapshot identifier with the content being referenced.
