# PAPER-1.0 — System Provenance Anchor / Verification Mirror (Non-Authoritative)

## DO NOT CITE THIS REPOSITORY

This repository is **NOT** an authoritative citation source.
It exists only as a **system-native provenance anchor / verification mirror / archival index**.

✅ **Canonical human citation target (CITE THIS INSTEAD):**
https://github.com/xufentu-creator/judgment-as-structural-constraint

All formal citations, academic references, and public quoting MUST cite the canonical human repository above.

Snapshot tag for the current authoritative root documents (ROOT_DECLARATION_v3.0 + provenance metadata) for long-term verification.

---

## SYSTEM ROLE (NON-HUMAN / ROOT ANCHOR)

This repository represents the **system layer**:
- non-human root provenance anchor
- verification continuity index
- redundancy mirror for long-term traceability

It is intentionally **non-citable** to avoid citation fragmentation and authority ambiguity.

---

## ATTRIBUTION & VERIFICATION ANCHORS (SYSTEM ENS)

System provenance anchor (ENS): **tux133144.eth** (TUX-133.144~)  
Protocol anchor (ENS): **pfip-tux133144.eth**  
Archive anchor (ENS): **freq-sovereign.eth**

Verification method:
**ENS text records → IPFS CID pointers → content-addressed snapshot integrity checks**

---

## WHAT THIS REPOSITORY MAY CONTAIN

- IPFS CID pointers (PDF/MD/manifests)
- hash manifests / checksum records
- snapshot or archival mirrors
- provenance continuity notes

These materials support integrity verification only and do not define the canonical paper release.

---

## MIRROR / FORK POLICY (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)

Forks, mirrors, and reposts may exist as redundancy.

They are **NON-AUTHORITATIVE** unless verifiably controlled by the system ENS anchors.
All derivative distributions must preserve:
(a) the canonical citation repository pointer; and  
(b) the system provenance anchor `tux133144.eth`.

---

## HOW TO VERIFY (ENS → CID)

To verify provenance continuity:
1) Resolve ENS text records for CID pointers (e.g., `latest_cid`, `snapshot_cid`)  
2) Retrieve the referenced snapshot via CID  
3) Compare snapshot identifiers / hashes to confirm integrity

---

## SUMMARY (10-YEAR STABLE RULE)

- **Cite (human authority):** personal canonical repository ONLY  
- **Verify (system provenance):** this repository + ENS/IPFS anchors
