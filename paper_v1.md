**ABSTRACT**

In contemporary digital environments, research outputs and conceptual structures can be replicated, paraphrased, or operationalized at scale, often without stable attribution. This creates an asymmetry: human authorship remains time-consuming and context-dependent, while replication becomes increasingly frictionless.

This paper proposes a provenance-first publication pattern that secures authorship continuity through verifiable public records. The proposed pattern separates (a) human-readable research exposition from (b) machine-verifiable provenance anchors. It also introduces a judgment-centered framing: many projects and intellectual structures do not fail due to execution, but due to the absence of early-stage judgment conditions—especially those related to falsifiability, verification, and exit mechanisms.

The contribution of this paper is a publication method, rather than an operational method. It provides a durable approach for producing research outputs that remain citable and traceable to a canonical source across time, platforms, and republishing cycles.

---

**I. INTRODUCTION**

(01) Digital ecosystems increasingly reward momentum over judgment. Content is frequently amplified not because it is valid, but because it is active. In this environment, human authorship and long-horizon research face a recurring challenge: attribution becomes unstable, and versions become ambiguous.

(02) The purpose of this paper is not to provide a success framework. It does not offer a better execution plan. It addresses a narrower but foundational problem: how to preserve human authorship continuity while enabling lawful quotation and academic reuse.

(03) A second motivation is structural. Many projects, including research-led initiatives, are advanced before their foundational premises are judged. When the early judgment layer is absent, later efforts often function as delayed failure rather than verified progress.

(04) This document therefore presents a provenance-first publication pattern and a judgment-first framing. The two are independent but mutually reinforcing.

---

**A. RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

(05) This paper addresses the following research questions:

[1] RQ1: How can authorship continuity be preserved in high-replication digital environments?

[2] RQ2: What minimal provenance primitives enable durable citation integrity over time and across platforms?

[3] RQ3: How can informative research exposition be separated from normative or enforceable claims to reduce misuse and interpretation drift?

---

**B. CONTRIBUTIONS**

(06) The contributions of this paper are:

[a] A provenance-first publication pattern separating human-readable research exposition from machine-verifiable anchors.

[b] A judgment-before-momentum framing, defining early-stage judgment thresholds frequently skipped in real-world project formation.

[c] A practical illustration of verifiable authorship continuity, using ENS identity pointers and IPFS CID content-addressed snapshots.

---

**C. METHODOLOGICAL NOTE**

(07) This paper uses design-pattern analysis and threat-model reasoning. It does not claim empirical causality. The paper focuses on publication infrastructure conditions that support stable attribution, version traceability, and resilient citation integrity.

---

**II. DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE**

A. DEFINITIONS

(08) For the purposes of this paper:

[a] Canonical source refers to the primary, authoritative release location designated by the author for citation and provenance.

[b] Provenance anchor refers to a stable identifier enabling attribution and continuity across platforms. In this work, ENS records are used as public identity pointers.

[c] Content-addressed archive refers to a storage pattern where the identifier is derived from content itself (e.g., IPFS CID), enabling integrity verification and immutable reference.

[d] Replication environment refers to a context where content may be copied, adapted, or operationalized rapidly and at scale, with limited friction and weak attribution controls.

---

B. SCOPE

(09) This paper focuses on authorship continuity and publication provenance. It does not prescribe medical, legal, or therapeutic practice. It does not present implementation instructions for automated systems. It is a research publication and provenance design pattern.

---

C. NORMATIVE STATUS

(10) This document is INFORMATIVE. It does not define mandatory requirements, operational compliance obligations, or enforceable standards. It presents a publication provenance pattern intended to strengthen attribution continuity, citation integrity, and verifiable version traceability.

---

**III. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

(11) The present environment produces two structural risks:

[a] Attribution drift. Over time, repeated reposting and paraphrasing detach concepts from their original author and date of creation.

[b] Version ambiguity. Multiple copies create uncertainty over which version is authoritative, validated, or intended to be referenced.

(12) These risks are not primarily technical. They are structural and social. Without a canonical release source, a work becomes fragmented into derivative variants.

(13) The central question is therefore: how can a human author publish research in a manner that remains citable and traceable, even when replication is inevitable?

---

**IV. PROVENANCE-FIRST PUBLICATION PATTERN**

A. PRINCIPLE

(14) The pattern is based on a separation of layers:

[a] Human-readable layer: the paper itself (text, claims, arguments, limitations).

[b] Machine-verifiable layer: canonical source designation plus public provenance anchors (ENS) plus immutable snapshot pointers (CID).

(15) The objective is not to prevent copying. The objective is to ensure that copying preserves traceability.

B. CANONICAL RELEASE MECHANISM

(16) The canonical mechanism includes:

[a] a single release repository designated as the v1.0 canonical source;

[b] explicit citation guidance indicating how third parties should reference the work;

[c] verifiable pointers enabling continuity, even if platform pages are removed or modified.

C. IMMUTABLE SNAPSHOT RECORD

(17) The snapshot record includes:

[a] IPFS CID pointers stored via ENS text records;

[b] version naming discipline (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0);

[c] optional integrity fields (SHA-256, signature strings, controller markers).

D. RELATED WORK (CONTEXTUAL POSITIONING)

(18) Provenance continuity and stable citation have been addressed through multiple infrastructures, including persistent identifiers (e.g., DOI-based systems), preprint archives, author identifiers, and cryptographic hash-based integrity verification.

(19) The approach in this paper emphasizes a minimal, verifiable pattern: a public attribution anchor (ENS) plus content-addressed snapshot pointers (IPFS CID), designed to remain resilient under platform drift and high replication conditions.

**V. JUDGMENT BEFORE MOMENTUM (FRAMING)**

(20) In applied domains, projects often progress without early-stage judgment conditions. A judgment-centered framing treats “judgment” as a precondition rather than a later-stage rationalization.

(21) The paper recognizes eight judgment thresholds frequently skipped in early project formation:

[a] Self-consistency: whether the structure holds without external resource reinforcement.

[b] Role-bound judgment: who judges and who bears consequences.

[c] Falsifiability: whether the judgment can be overturned by evidence.

[d] Verification: whether progress equals validation or merely continuation.

[e] Counterfactual legitimacy: whether not-doing is a permitted option.

[f] Permission constraints: whether decisions are shaped by incentive environments.

[g] Capital substitution: whether funding replaces reasoning.

[h] Exit design: whether the system allows withdrawal when judgment fails.

(22) These thresholds are not a procedure; they are barriers. Their purpose is not to motivate continuation, but to legitimize stopping when required.

---

**VI. THREAT MODEL AND LIMITATIONS**

A. THREAT MODEL

(23) This publication pattern addresses:

[a] unauthorized republishing without attribution.

[b] derivative summaries that obscure the origin.

[c] multi-platform version drift.

[d] weak timestamp clarity.

(24) The pattern further anticipates the following replication behaviors:

[a] partial copying in aggregated posts without canonical pointers.

[b] paraphrasing that erases origin while preserving structure.

[c] repackaging of derivative copies as “original work”.

[d] forks or mirror repositories presented as canonical sources.

(25) This threat model does not treat replication as an anomaly. Replication is treated as an environmental constant. The objective is not to prevent replication, but to preserve traceability under replication.

B. LIMITATIONS

(26) The pattern does not guarantee technical prevention of copying. It guarantees traceability where verification mechanisms are honored and where public record persists.

(27) It also does not attempt to resolve interpretive disputes. It provides verifiable anchors and version continuity.

(28) The document’s attribution intent statements do not override applicable law, platform terms, or lawful exceptions.

(29) This document is provided “as is”, without warranties.

C. NON-NORMATIVE AND NON-OPERATIONAL DISCLAIMER

(30) This paper is not an automation specification and does not provide operational instructions for technical enforcement. It is a publication provenance pattern and an authorship continuity method.

(31) This paper is not legal advice and does not create any legal obligations.

(32) This paper is informational and does not provide medical, therapeutic, or diagnostic claims.

---

**VII. WORKED EXAMPLE (MINIMAL VERIFICATION SCENARIO)**

(33) To clarify the pattern as a verifiable publication infrastructure, a minimal verification scenario is described below.

(34) A canonical repository publishes Preprint v1.0 as the authoritative release. The repository includes:

[a] a version label (v1.0).

[b] an explicit canonical citation statement.

[c] a verification pointer section.

(35) The author’s ENS attribution anchors publish text records pointing to immutable snapshot identifiers:

[a] ENS text records include IPFS CID pointers (e.g., pfip:latest_cid, pfip:snapshot).

[b] the CID identifiers are content-addressed and remain stable for identical content.

[c] the ENS record update transaction provides an external timestamp.

(36) A third party later republishes the work or portions of the work. The reader can verify provenance continuity by:

[a] locating the canonical citation statement.

[b] resolving ENS text records to retrieve CID pointers.

[c] comparing the CID-referenced snapshot with the republished content.

[d] confirming that the canonical repository remains the authoritative citation target.

(37) This scenario does not require trust in the republisher. It requires only that the reader can resolve publicly available pointers and compare immutable snapshot identifiers.

---

**VIII. CANONICAL SOURCE, MIRRORS, AND GOVERNANCE**

A. CANONICAL SOURCE DEFINITION

(38) The canonical source is the only authoritative citation target for this work. Mirror copies may exist, but canonical citation must point to the release repository designated in the cover page of this document.

(39) Mirror copies are permitted as redundancy. Mirror copies do not become canonical by reposting, forking, or altering headings.

B. MIRROR POLICY

(40) Mirror copies may exist across platforms (e.g., personal repositories, social platforms, archival systems). Such mirrors shall be treated as non-authoritative unless they explicitly preserve:

[a] the canonical repository pointer; and

[b] the primary attribution anchor (tux133144.eth).

(41) Mirrors that remove provenance pointers or present themselves as canonical are considered provenance-breaking derivatives.

C. VERSION AUTHORITY

(42) Only the controller of the canonical release repository and the listed ENS attribution anchors may publish official version updates.

(43) Forks or derivative repositories may exist but must not be presented as authoritative versions. Derivative versions must explicitly preserve canonical pointers.

D. VERSION NAMING DISCIPLINE

(44) Version naming is recommended as follows:

[a] v1.0 — formal v1.0 release.

[b] v1.0.1 — typographical or non-substantive fixes.

[c] v1.1 — minor revision (no structural change to provenance intent).

[d] v2.0 — major revision (new framing, scope expansion, or updated provenance primitives).

(45) Newer versions may supersede earlier versions. Earlier versions remain archived for provenance continuity.

**X. CONCLUSION**

(51) High-replication environments change the default meaning of publication. Visibility no longer guarantees authorship continuity, and copying no longer implies citation.

(52) A provenance-first publication pattern restores an essential condition for long-horizon research: stable attribution through verifiable anchors. It does not aim to stop replication; it aims to ensure that replication remains traceable to a canonical source.

(53) The paper therefore proposes a model of publication in which authorship continuity is treated as a first-order research infrastructure component, rather than an afterthought.
