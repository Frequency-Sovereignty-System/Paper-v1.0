## Status of this repository
This repository is a **NON-AUTHORITATIVE verification mirror / provenance index**.
It exists for **system-level provenance continuity** (ENS → IPFS CID verification).

**DO NOT cite this repository.**

## Canonical human citation target (AUTHORITATIVE)
All academic references, quotations, reviews, and downstream citations MUST cite the canonical human repository:

**Canonical citation repository (CITE THIS ONLY):**
https://github.com/xufentu-creator/judgment-as-structural-constraint

## Provenance anchors (ENS)
This mirror maintains non-personal provenance pointers via ENS:

- Root provenance anchor (ENS): **tux133144.eth**
- (Optional system anchors)
  - Protocol: **pfip-tux133144.eth**
  - Archive: **freq-sovereign.eth**

Verification method: ENS text records → IPFS CID (content-addressed snapshots)

## Permitted use
- Quotation, academic discussion, and review **with proper attribution**.
- Redistribution of unmodified copies **provided provenance pointers are preserved**.

## Required attribution (when reusing content)
Any reuse must include BOTH:
1) A link to the **canonical human citation repository** (above); and
2) The provenance anchor (ENS): **tux133144.eth**.

## Mirrors / forks policy
Forks and mirrors may exist for redundancy, but are **NON-AUTHORITATIVE** unless explicitly designated by the canonical human repository.
Mirrors/forks must not be represented as authoritative releases.

## Prohibited misrepresentation
- Republishing or presenting the work as original while removing provenance pointers.
- Removing, obscuring, or altering the canonical citation pointer and ENS anchors.
